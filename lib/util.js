 * during bootstrapping this function needs to be rewritten using some native
 * functions as prototype setup using normal JavaScript does not work as
 * expected during bootstrapping (see mirror.js in r114903).
 *
 * @param {function} ctor Constructor function which needs to inherit the
 *     prototype.
 * @param {function} superCtor Constructor function to inherit prototype from.
 * @throws {TypeError} Will error if either constructor is null, or if
 *     the super constructor lacks a prototype.
